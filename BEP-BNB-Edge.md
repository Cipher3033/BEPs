## Abstract
BNB Edge is a decentralized edge computing protocol enabling individuals to contribute underutilized hardware (e.g., Raspberry Pi, smartphones, home servers) to execute encrypted computational tasks verified via zero-knowledge Proof of Computing.  

The protocol integrates with BNB Greenfield for decentralized storage of processed outputs, forming a full-stack compute-storage-settlement infrastructure within BNB Chain.

## Motivation
Centralized cloud providers dominate compute infrastructure, creating cost, privacy, and resilience limitations.  
BNB Chain currently lacks a decentralized compute marketplace optimized for edge and IoT devices.  

BNB Edge enables decentralized AI inference, distributed data processing, and monetization of idle hardware.

## Specification
BNB Edge introduces:
- Edge node registration with BNB staking  
- Encrypted task marketplace  
- zk-Proof of Computing verification  
- On-chain reward distribution  
- Integration with BNB Greenfield storage  

## Benefits
- Expands BNB Chain into decentralized cloud infrastructure  
- Enables AI + IoT workloads on BNB  
- Creates new BNB utility demand  
- Allows users to monetize idle devices  

## Backward Compatibility
No impact on existing BNB Chain functionality.  
BNB Edge operates as an optional compute layer via smart contracts and node software.

## Security Considerations
zk-Proof verification, staking and slashing, encrypted tasks, and reputation scoring secure the network.
